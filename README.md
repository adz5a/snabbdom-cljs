[![Clojars Project](http://clojars.org/cljsjs/boot-cljsjs/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/cljsjs/boot-cljsjs)

This project provides tasks for the [boot][boot] build system to
package and use Javascript dependencies in Clojurescript projects.

- [cljsjs.app][cljsjs-app] provides tasks to be used in application
  project to add JS files from diffrent sources to fileset so they can
  be used by [boot-cljs][boot-cljs].

## Using libraries

If you are using [boot-cljs][boot-cljs] you might want to use external
JS libraries with your project. Using boot-cljsjs you can add those
external files from jar files instead of copying them to your project.

Using boot-cljsjs you can use JS libraries from three sources in your
project.

1. Cljsjs packaged jars
  - When using Cljsjs jars the transitive dependencies are added automatically to fileset
2. Webjars
3. Any jar-files containing js-files

For each source we have own task used to bring files from the source
to the fileset.

1. `from-cljsjs`
  - This task will go through all jars in your classpath and find
    files in cljsjs prefix.
  - All files will be copied to filesset
2. `from-webjars`
  - This task will go through all jars in your classpath and find
    files in webjars prefix.
  - You need to provide name for file you want to import,
    e.g. "momentjs/moment.js"
    - This would import e.g. file
      "META-INF/resources/webjars/momentjs/2.8.3/moment.js" depending
      on version etc of the dependancy.
  - To import multiple files from Webjars, you would call this task
    multiple times.
3. `from-jars`
  - This task will just copy a file of given path from classpath. In
  effect this just calls `(io/resource path)` and copies found file to
  fileset.

### Why this works

[Boot-cljs][boot-cljs] will search fileset for files ending in
`.inc.js`, `.ext.js` and `.lib.js` and uses the found files for cljs
compiler options.

In any case, on your html code you only need to include one source
tag.  This works because in `:advanced` mode all files are
concatenated into one.  In development mode you'll be using
`:optimizations :none` and `:unified-mode true` and in that case
[boot-cljs][boot-cljs] will write a shim JS which will load your all
external libraries.

NOTE: In development mode the target file should by inside your
docroot so the files are accessible through your webserver.

### Transitive dependencies

Using Cljsjs jars transitive dependencies can automatically be added to fileset and thus to cljs build.
For example if your application depends on a Cljs library which depends on `cljsjs/momentjs` the only code you
need to add to your project is call to call `from-cljsjs` task. Because we are using Maven dependencies if you need, you can depend on `cljsjs/momentjs` from your own project if you e.g. need to use a new version.

Cljsjs jars include both development (non-minified) and production (minified) versions and you can select one being used by `from-cljsjs` `:profile` option.

### Example

NOTE: This a bad example because React is added to fileset twice.

```clj
(set-env! :dependencies '[[org.webjars/momentjs "2.8.3"]
                          [com.facebook/react "0.12.2"]
                          [cljsjs/react "0.12.1"]

                          [cljsjs/boot-cljsjs "0.3.0-SNAPSHOT"]])

(require '[cljsjs.app :refer :all])

(deftask dev []
  (comp
    (from-cljsjs :target "public")
    (from-jars :path "react/react.js" :target "public/react.inc.js")
    (from-webjars :name "momentjs/moment.js" :target "public/moment.inc.js")
    (watch)))

(deftask package []
  (comp
    (from-cljsjs :target "public" :profile :production)
    (from-jars :package true :path "react/min/react.min.js" :target "public/react.inc.js")
    (from-jars :package true :path "react/externs/react.js" :target "public/react.ext.js")
    (from-webjars :package true :name "momentjs/min/moment.min.js" :target "public/moment.inc.js")))
```
